Things fall apart and time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl, you showed her the world
You fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin' on my shoulder, all I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now I know that you love me, you don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind
All the time
Like a fever, like I'm burning alive
Like a sign
Did I cross the line?
Mm, hm
Well, good things don't last (good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (life moves so fast)
I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better)
'Cause she couldn't be (she couldn't be)
More different from me (more different)
Happy and free (happy and free) in leather
